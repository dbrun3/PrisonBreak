# 440-Group-19-Fall-2023
Prison Break, developed for CS 440 Group 19 for Fall 2023

Developed by Dylan Brunelle, Mitchell Jones, Daniel Kim, and Dua'a Hussain.
Original concept by Saikrishna Yadavalli, Hassam Hussain, Tommy Castino, Joshua Peterson for their development project.

This game was designed from scratch, without an engine, in order to learn about the game making process from the bottom up. All assets were drawn by the team.

If you have a windows pc, the game is already built for you! To play the game, download the x64 file which contains the necessary assets and dlls and run PrisonBreak.exe on Windows. Otherwise you can compile the code yourself on an os of your choosing, but make sure you use download the correct dependencies for your machine: SDL2, SDL2_image, libpng16-16, zlib1
